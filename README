A new release 2.13.2 of RMagick is now available on github.

This release will fix the installation issues due to ruby 1.9.3 and ImageMagick 6.8+. For now please install directly from github if you are using bundle add the following to your Gemfile: 

gem 'rmagick', '2.13.2', :git=>'http://github.com/rmagick/rmagick.git'

We will update rubygems.org metadata asap and inform you and then you will be able to install from rubygems.org.
